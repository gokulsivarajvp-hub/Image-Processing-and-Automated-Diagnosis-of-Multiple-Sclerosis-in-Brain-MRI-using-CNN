# Image-Processing-and-Automated-Diagnosis-of-Multiple-Sclerosis-in-Brain-MRI-using-CNN
This project is about Diagnosing Multiple Sclerosis using Brain MRI. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the formation of lesions in the brain and spinal cord. This project proposes an automated approach for the segmentation and detection of MS lesions from brain MRI scans using deep learning.
